## Notes

We were not taught how to code in a proper manner, so there are multiple workarounds, and some silly ideas:
* I've put all flags in a flagship class instance and passed it everywhere. I guess I was into pirates.
* GUI is tragic, but I guess that was not the point of doing this simulation.

## Built With

* Eclipse, now i switched to intelliJ
