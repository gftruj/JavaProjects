# Diplomacy Quiz

This is an android app consisting of a primitive search system, data display, and a quiz.

Made in the late 2015' in a weekend for a friend who had a weird exam. 

Had fun seeing how easy it is to deploy as a signed APK for android, You can download it [here](http://gftruj.nazwa.pl/diplomacypls/app-release.apk).

## Quick description

* The search system just compares the input string to the records in the database. The keyboards "enter" turns into "search" for convinience sake, and it cuts out empty spaces just in case.
* The Wiki is just a for loop, displaying all records in the database.
* The quiz gets a country, chooses one category, and two other records to display as clickable buttons.
wanted to implement a permutation without repetition, I should be working, had some rare errors with 2 same anwsers. 
* GUI - the app is quite ugly, I just wanted to test out the base button style, custom .jpg's as button states, and nested buttons/input Fields.
* Some records are ridiculous, all of them are taken from the .pdf provided as lecture material.


### TODO

* GUI Improvements, as it looks bad.
* Optimalisation, it's small, so I made way to much manually, instead of dynamic solutions.
* Decoy anwsers in the quiz.
